Project for practice with external APIs from https://www.theodinproject.com

In this case, I used Flickr's API to grab images belonging to a user using their NSID.

I used this Flickr gem to access the API: https://github.com/cyclotron3k/flickr
and I used Figaro to set the environment variables: https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro
